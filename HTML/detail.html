    <h1>The Details disclosure element</h1>
    <p>The details HTML element creates a disclosure widget <br> in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled
        into an "open" state. <br> A summary or label must be provided using the summary element.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Details</summary>
            Something small enough to escape casual notice.
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>System Requirements</summary>
            <p>
                Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
                memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
                as some form of output device is recommended.
