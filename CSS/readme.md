## CSS Position Absolute

An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed)

## CSS Link Active

The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

## Css Class

The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.

## Css Element-Selector

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

# CSS Position Fixed

Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, with the exception that the element's containing block is the
initial containing block established by the viewport, unless any ancestor has transform, perspective, or filter property
set to something other than none (see CSS Transforms Spec), which then causes that ancestor to take the place of the
elements containing block. This can be used to create a "floating" element that stays in the same position regardless of
scrolling. In the example below, box "One" is fixed at 80 pixels from the top of the page and 10 pixels from the left.
Even after scrolling, it remains in the same place relative to the viewport. Also, when the will-change property is set
to transform, a new containing block is established.
